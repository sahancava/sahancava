### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hello, this is Åžahan. I am a software developer based in Ä°stanbul. Currently working as a senior deployment engineer but besides my professional career, I am really into blockchain development. Thus, I've been to lead smart contract developer for various projects, which I can provide if asked.
